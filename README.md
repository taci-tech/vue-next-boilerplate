<blockquote>
VueBP is a Vue 3 Boilerplate project for starting any web app you want.<br>
Ready-to-go with your favourite vue-router &amp; vite.<br>
Containing sample pages and some helpful built-in components.
</blockquote>

## Why use VueBP?

To save you times on initializing an empty project and setting everything up.
And more importantly, this project is probably going to stay up to date with new `vue-next` releases.

I am trying to make it an optimized well-done starter kit for most of the Vue developers (and newbies).
With more and more examples coming, it could be too useful for you.
Not just a framework starter kit, but a perfect starting point for your extraordinary Web UI.

## What's included

- **`vue-next`**
- **`vue-router`**
- **`vite`**
- Some sample pages (a toy home, a 404, etc)
- Some basic sample components (a header, a footer, `defined-link`, `defined-button`, etc)
- Some basic sample styles (given a few `.scss` files)

## Get started

Simply clone or download this repo.
I suggest you to download it and initialize another git repo instead of forking one.
And before doing the following steps, you need to first know how to use terminal and get directed to the root folder of VueBP.

#### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

#### Serve the app locally

```sh
yarn dev
```

#### Build for production

```sh
yarn build
```

#### Deploy to GitHub Pages

```sh
sh deploy.sh
```

## Future Plan

- [ ] Make VueBP a better starting place (font, grid, a well-done ready-to-go layout structure, etc).
